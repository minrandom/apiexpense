## Google Drive Integration

The **Google Drive** integration allows users to upload receipts and profile pictures to Google Drive. Follow these steps to configure Google Drive API:

1. Obtain Google API credentials and create a new project in the **Google Cloud Console**.
2. Enable the **Google Drive API** for your project.
3. Download the credentials file (`credentials.json`) and store it in the `app/` folder of your Laravel project.
4. Set up the `GoogleDriveService` class for uploading files.

To upload files, use the endpoints for profile, income, or expense with the `file` field in the payload.
